    "\n",
    "- **winequality-red.csv**: This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Columns:\n",
    "* fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).\n",
    "* volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.\n",
    "* citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines.\n",
    "* residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops.\n",
    "* chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine.\n",
    "* free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion.\n",
    "* total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02.\n",
    "* density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content\n",
    "* ph: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale.\n",
    "* sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels.\n",
    "* quality: 0-6.5 BAD (0); 6.5-10 GOOD(1).\n",
